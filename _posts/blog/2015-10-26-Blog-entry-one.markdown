So back in Sept. of 2015, I was working as a marketing coordinator at a local tech startup. Being fresh out of college, I hadn't really thought about the direction in which I wanted to move my career towards. I had all these grand ideas about myself, and what I wanted to be doing a few years into the future, but nothing ever solidified into a disciplined plan of action.

After having talked with some of my fellow peers that have taken the plunge into programming, I was convinced that this would be a good path for me to take. I always had a love for things technology, but never had the foresight to really take it upon myself to purse it as an education or a career option. I realized at that time the importance of learning and mastering a craft and how it directly correlates to our future success.

So come early October of 2015, I decided to take the first step into the world of programming, which led me to where I am today, a current student at MakerSquare LA. In the current industry, there is still a bit of negative connotation associated with coding bootcamps or immersive programs. Most doubters believe that one can't become a proficient developer in a span of 3 months. What people fail to see however, is the amount of previous technical knowledge that is required to even pass the initial technical interview to get into an already highly selective program. Also, the amount of experience that you get being able to pair program and actually create live apps with a team 11 hours a day 6 days a week is unparalleled even at a 4 year university. Of course I had my own doubts as well coming into this, but 6 weeks in, and I feel this has been the best decision i've ever made.

Programming is a craft that takes 100% of your time and dedication, and is a process that emphasizes autonomous learning. Adjusting to this type of learning was definitely a challenge at first, but the journey to becoming a full able self-learner was a very satisfying one.

I wouldn't recommend programming to everyone, but I definitely recommend taking the time to really think about what you would love doing, no matter how hard it may be to learn, and really push yourself to reach that goal. Really think about what you're currently doing, and if you'll be able to enjoy doing it day in and day out 8 hours a day. We are most engaged and fulfilled when we are constantly learning, and it would be a shame to waste our potential.
